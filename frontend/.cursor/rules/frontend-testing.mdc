# Frontend Testing Patterns

## Testing Framework
- Use Jest as the primary testing framework
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Implement proper test utilities and helpers
- Use TypeScript for all test files

## Component Testing
- Test component rendering and props
- Test user interactions and events
- Test component state changes
- Test accessibility features
- Test responsive behavior

## Testing Best Practices
- Write tests that resemble user behavior
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Implement proper test isolation

## Test Structure
- Organize tests by component or feature
- Use proper describe and it blocks
- Implement proper test setup and teardown
- Use test utilities for common operations
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Mocking Strategies
- Mock API calls and external services
- Mock browser APIs when necessary
- Use proper mock implementations
- Test error handling scenarios
- Implement proper mock cleanup

## Accessibility Testing
- Test keyboard navigation
- Test screen reader compatibility
- Test ARIA attributes
- Test focus management
- Use accessibility testing tools

## Performance Testing
- Test component rendering performance
- Test bundle size impact
- Test lazy loading implementations
- Test caching strategies
- Use performance monitoring tools

## E2E Testing
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical flows
- Test user journeys and workflows
- Test cross-browser compatibility
- Test responsive design
- Use proper E2E testing tools
